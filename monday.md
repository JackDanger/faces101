Introductions, set expectations, ensure everybody has a computer.

### 10:20

Set up an editing environment. Practice the following:

* creating a new file with a text editor and opening that file in Chrome
* opening up any file on the hard drive with Chrome (use example files from
  this repo)
* typing random words into a .html file, saving the file, reloading Chrome

Give a basic overview of HTML:

* talk about opening and closing tags
* how tags affect all the tags inside them
* how everything is basically a rectangle full of rectangles
* Have the students write their own P, DIV, SPAN, STRONG, EM, and IMG tags (if
  there's time)

### 11:00 (switch instructors)

Download http://squareup.com to a local file (save with all assets)

Open it in both the text editor and Chrome

Find the "&lt;div class='pricing-amount'&gt;2.75%&lt;/div&gt;" And practice editing
it according to the following:

* Edit the text to say something else
* wrap the text in &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags, then &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tags
* add 2 new &lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt; tags inside and see how they stack
* try &lt;p&gt; tags
* Insert an image tag where the src is the URL for the student's
  personal photo in the people directory (their own face)

### 11:40

Have students open http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/

Have them click 'animate' and scroll down to the first 'Demo' line. Let
them play for a minute with demos.

give a basic intro to jQuery; explain why you'd use it.

### 12:00 (exercises begin, folks can leave at will)

### Exercise 1
Download google.com and change the logo to your own photo
### Exercise 2
Download news.google.com and make one of the headlines funny
(You'll need to use CMD+F to find text, this file is full of junk)
### Exercise 3
Delete as much gobbledygook as you can from the Google News page source
without changing the look of the page very much.
### Exercise 4
Download www.everydayim.com and change the HUSSLIN' text to something else. If
you're feeling game: record your own sound file and replace the
hustle.mp3 with your own.
