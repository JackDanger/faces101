# HTML+Javascript 101: Tuesday

### 10:00 (first instructor)

Open by asking folks how the class is going. Anything need changing?

Goals for today: Understand basic CSS concepts, edit existing code, feel dangerous.
Stretch goals: CSS selectors

### 10:10

Restore yesterday's editing environment. Make sure they can edit a file
and preview it in Chrome.

Direct students to download the html file here:
<pre>
<a
href="http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html"
>http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html</a>
</pre>

Open it in Chrome and talk through the various effects.
Have them open the Web Inspector and take a closer look at the the
connection between DOM ids and styles.

10:30

Have the students edit the file to play with the various CSS styles.
Have them make a div as ugly as possible by applying all 6 styles
to one of the &lt;div&gt; tags.

10:45

Put the students in pairs and have them inline the styles. The result
should be a that they can delete the STYLE tag and it still looks right.

### 11:00 (switch instructors)

Download http://squareup.com to a local file (save with all assets)

Open it in both the text editor and Chrome

Instruct students to copy the &lt;script&gt;&lt;script&gt; tag from the
previous example and paste it at the extreme bottom of the saved Square
home page HTML.

Have students change one of the jQuery selectors to bind to
"#user-password" (the PW element of signup form).
Have students change the target to ".register-fg"

Goal: Clicking the password field should trigger slideToggle (or some
other effect) on the floating hand image.
