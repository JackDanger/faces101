<h1>HTML+Javascript 101: Tuesday</h1>

<h3>10:00 (first instructor)</h3>

<p>Open by asking folks how the class is going. Anything need changing?
Consider having students work in pairs.</p>

<p>Goals for today: Understand basic CSS concepts, edit existing code, feel dangerous.
Stretch goals: CSS selectors</p>

<h3>10:10</h3>

<p>Restore yesterday's editing environment. Make sure they can edit a file
and preview it in Chrome.</p>

<p>Direct students to open the html file here:</p>

<pre>
<a
href="http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html"
>http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Open it in Chrome and talk through the various effects.
Have them open the Web Inspector and take a closer look at the the
connection between DOM ids and styles.</p>

<h3>10:30</h3>

<p>Have the students download and edit the file to play with the various
CSS styles. Have them make a div as ugly as possible by applying all
6 styles to one of the &lt;div&gt; tags.</p>

<h3>10:45</h3>

<p>Put the students in pairs and have them inline the styles. The result
should be that they can delete the STYLE tag and it still looks the same.</p>

<h3>11:00 (switch instructors)</h3>

<p>Direct students to open</p>

<pre>
<a
href="https://squareup.com/news"
>https://squareup.com/news</a>
</pre>

<p>And look at it with Web Inspector. Have them do all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>uncheck the margin-top on the 'Square News' h1</li>
<li>uncheck the color on 'In The News' h3</li>
<li>selec the '.hero-section p', double-click the style list and add a
color.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have the students download the page and save it for editing.</p>

<p>Talk them, step by step, through the steps necessary to turn the page
they just downloaded into this one:</p>

<pre>
<a
href="http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html"
>http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Steps they'll need to perform:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tag</li>
<li>add a rule for something they want to override (tell them to just copy
what they see as the rule in Web Inspector)</li>
<li>write a new style between the curly braces</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: tell them it's okay to use !important freely.</p>

<p>Likely problems: quieter students might be lost. Take ten minutes for
the students to take turns explaining what you've said so far today.</p>

<h3>11:35</h3>

<p>Direct students back to this page:</p>

<pre>
<a
href="http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html"
>http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Have them delete and re-download it if they need to.</p>

<p>Talk about the process of using Web Inspector to find selectors
and play with changes. Have them use Web Inspector to invent new changes
to this page.</p>

<p>They should copy the changes they come up with to the page's
&lt;style&gt; tag so they changes persist.</p>

<p>Ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set small widths on all P tags</li>
<li>Set a different color for the H1</li>
<li>Set a different background-color for the .hero-unit</li>
</ul>
