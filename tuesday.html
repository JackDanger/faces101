<h1>HTML+Javascript 101: Tuesday</h1>

<h3>10:00 (first instructor)</h3>

<p>Open by asking folks how the class is going. Anything need changing?</p>

<p>Goals for today: Understand basic CSS concepts, edit existing code, feel dangerous.
Stretch goals: CSS selectors</p>

<h3>10:10</h3>

<p>Restore yesterday's editing environment. Make sure they can edit a file
and preview it in Chrome.</p>

<p>Direct students to download the html file here:</p>

<pre>
<a
href="http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html"
>http://jackdanger.github.com/faces101/1_css_demo.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Open it in Chrome and talk through the various effects.
Have them open the Web Inspector and take a closer look at the the
connection between DOM ids and styles.</p>

<p>10:30</p>

<p>Have the students edit the file to play with the various CSS styles.
Have them make a div as ugly as possible by applying all 6 styles
to one of the &lt;div&gt; tags.</p>

<p>10:45</p>

<p>Put the students in pairs and have them inline the styles. The result
should be a that they can delete the STYLE tag and it still looks right.</p>

<h3>11:00 (switch instructors)</h3>

<p>Download http://squareup.com to a local file (save with all assets)</p>

<p>Open it in both the text editor and Chrome</p>

<p>Instruct students to copy the &lt;script&gt;&lt;script&gt; tag from the
previous example and paste it at the extreme bottom of the saved Square
home page HTML.</p>

<p>Have students change one of the jQuery selectors to bind to
"#user-password" (the PW element of signup form).
Have students change the target to ".register-fg"</p>

<p>Goal: Clicking the password field should trigger slideToggle (or some
other effect) on the floating hand image.</p>
