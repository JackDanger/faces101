# HTML+Javascript 101

This is a 5-day class designed to give students familiarity with
manipulating web pages and adding basic Javascript effects. It is a
survey course that touches several topics lightly and not a mastery
course.

Each day is a 3-hour course divided in three sections:

* 1st hour: instructor A leads teaching of half the material
* 2nd hour: instructor B leads teaching for the last half
* 3rd hour: exercises and hands-on tutoring
