<h1>HTML+Javascript 101: Monday</h1>

<h3>10:00 (first instructor)</h3>

<p>Introductions, set expectations, ensure everybody has a computer.</p>

<h3>10:20</h3>

<p>Set up an editing environment. Practice the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a new file with a text editor and opening that file in Chrome</li>
<li>opening up any file on the hard drive with Chrome (use example files from
this repo)</li>
<li>typing random words into a .html file, saving the file, reloading Chrome</li>
</ul>

<p>Give a basic overview of HTML:</p>

<ul>
<li>talk about opening and closing tags</li>
<li>how tags affect all the tags inside them</li>
<li>how everything is basically a rectangle full of rectangles</li>
<li>Have the students write their own P, DIV, SPAN, STRONG, EM, and IMG tags (if
there's time)</li>
</ul>

<h3>11:00 (switch instructors)</h3>

<p>Download http://squareup.com to a local file (save as "web page,
complete" so it saves all assets)</p>

<p>Open the HTML page in both the text editor and Chrome</p>

<p>Teach the students how to find text in a file (CMD+F)</p>

<p>Find the "&lt;div class='pricing-amount'&gt;2.75%&lt;/div&gt;" And practice editing
it according to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the text to say something else</li>
<li>wrap the text in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tags, then &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tags</li>
<li>add 2 new &lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt; tags inside and see how they stack (you might want to explain the <em>very</em> basics of the box model</li>
<li>have them add multiple &lt;p&gt; tags with text in them</li>
<li>Insert an image tag where the SRC is the URL for the student's
personal photo in the people directory (their own face)</li>
</ul>

<h3>11:40</h3>

<p>Have students open http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/</p>

<p>Have them click 'animate' and scroll down to the first 'Demo' line. Let
them play for a minute with demos.</p>

<p>give a basic intro to jQuery; explain why you'd use it.</p>

<h3>12:00 (exercises begin, folks can leave at will)</h3>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>Download google.com and change the logo to your own photo</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Download news.google.com and make one of the headlines funny
(You'll need to use CMD+F to find text, this file is full of junk)</p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

<p>Delete as much gobbledygook as you can from the Google News page source
without changing the look of the page very much.</p>

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>

<p>Download www.everydayim.com and change the HUSSLIN' text to something else. If
you're feeling game: record your own sound file and replace the
hustle.mp3 with your own.</p>
